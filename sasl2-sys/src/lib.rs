//! Bindings to Cyrus SASL.
//!
//! This crate provides raw bindings to the [Cyrus SASL library][upstream],
//! libsasl2. Each module corresponds to a public header file in the [C
//! API][c-api].
//!
//! # Build configuration
//!
//! ## Vendored
//!
//! If the `vendored` Cargo feature is enabled, a bundled copy of libsasl2 will
//! be compiled and statically linked. The libsasl2 version will generally track
//! the latest upstream release. Note that the version number of this crate is
//! unrelated to the bundled version of libsasl2.
//!
//! sasl2-sys is currently bundling libsasl2 [v2.1.27].
//!
//! When configuring the bundled library, sasl2-sys is intentionally
//! conservative in the features it enables. All optional features are disabled
//! by default. The following Cargo features can be used to re-enable features
//! as necessary.
//!
//!   * **`gssapi-vendored`** enables the GSSAPI plugin (`--enable-gssapi`) by
//!      building and statically linking a copy of MIT's Kerberos implementation
//!      using the [krb5-src] crate.
//!
//!   * **`plain`** enables the PLAIN plugin (`--enable-plain`).
//!
//!   * **`scram`** enables the SCRAM plugin (`--enable-scram`). This requires
//!     linking against OpenSSL via the [openssl-sys] crate.
//!
//! Note that specifying any of these features implies `vendored`.
//!
//! For convenience, the `vendored` feature of the [openssl-sys] crate is
//! re-exported as the `openssl-vendored` feature. This feature is unlikely to
//! be useful unless used in conjuction with the `scram` feature.
//!
//! The eventual goal is to expose each libsasl2 feature behind a Cargo feature
//! of the same name. Pull requests on this front are welcomed.
//!
//! ## System
//!
//! Without the `vendored` Cargo feature, sasl2-sys will search for the libsasl2
//! library and headers in several standard locations. If the `pkg-config`
//! feature is enabled, as it is by default, pkg-config will be queried for the
//! location of the sasl2 library.
//!
//! To override the automatic search, set the `SASL2_DIR` environment variable
//! to the path of the directory containing the desired libsasl2 directory.
//!
//! If the layout of the libsasl2 directory is nonstandard, set the
//! `SASL2_LIB_DIR` and `SASL2_INCLUDE_DIR` environment variables to the path of
//! the directory containining the libsasl2 libraries and headers, respectively.
//! These environment variables take precedence over `SASL2_DIR` if set.
//!
//! When linking against a system library, dynamic linking is preferred unless
//! the `SASL2_STATIC` environment variable is set.
//!
//! # Platform support
//!
//! Upstream supports [most major platforms][upstream-platforms], but sasl2-sys
//! is only tested on recent versions of Ubuntu, CentOS, and macOS. Patches that
//! improve support for other platforms are welcome.
